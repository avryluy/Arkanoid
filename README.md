# Arkanoid

This repo houses my personal project to learn about game development and the C++ language. As a sound designer for linear media that wanted to work on video games, this was a lofty goal I made after speaking with some game developers and self-persuing interactive design. Having only a year of Python programming experience and a bit of C# in Unity, I knew it would be a challenge to learn C++ and the fundamentals of getting a game program running.

This project has definitely taken me longer than anticipated, but it has been a fantastic learning experience. Working on this project has taught me so much about what it takes to create objects, render visuals, and process audio in real time. Not only has my programming skills increased from this, but my appreciation of game development has skyrocketed. There is still so much to learn and get better at, but I am excited to keep exploring this path with a better understanding than when I first began.

To build this imitation of Arkanoid, I used the following libraries:

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)
- [Libsndfile](https://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/)

This project was developed for Windows, and will likely not be developed for other platforms.
